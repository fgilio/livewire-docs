            "content": "Livewire and Alpine provide plenty of utilities for building dynamic components directly in your HTML, however, there are times when it's helpful to break out of the HTML and execute plain JavaScript for your component. Livewire's @script and @assets directive allow you to do this in a predictable, maintainable way.\nTo execute bespoke JavaScript in your Livewire component, simply wrap a <script> element with @script and @endscript. This will tell Livewire to handle the execution of this JavaScript.\nBecause scripts inside @script are handled by Livewire, they are executed at the perfect time after the page has loaded, but before the Livewire component has rendered. This means you no longer need to wrap your scripts in document.addEventListener('...') to load them properly.\nThis also means that lazily or conditionally loaded Livewire components are still able to execute JavaScript after the page has initialized.\nHere's a more full example where you can do something like register a JavaScript action that is used in your Livewire component.\nTo learn more about JavaScript actions, visit the actions documentation.\nAnother helpful feature of using @script for your JavaScript is that you automatically have access to your Livewire component's $wire object.\nHere's an example of using a simple setInterval to refresh the component every 2 seconds (You could easily do this with wire:poll, but it's a simple way to demonstrate the point):\nYou can learn more about $wire on the $wire documentation.\nIn addition to designating entire methods to be evaluated in JavaScript, you can use the js() method to evaluate smaller, individual expressions on the backend.\nThis is generally useful for performing some kind of client-side follow-up after a server-side action is performed.\nFor example, here is an example of a CreatePost component that triggers a client-side alert dialog after the post is saved to the database:\nThe JavaScript expression alert('Post saved!') will now be executed on the client after the post has been saved to the database on the server.\nYou can access the current component's $wire object inside the expression.\nThe @script directive is useful for executing a bit of JavaScript every time a Livewire component loads, however, there are times you might want to load entire script and style assets on the page along with the component.\nHere is an example of using @assets to load a date picker library called Pikaday and initialize it inside your component using @script:\nWhen this component loads, Livewire will make sure any @assets are loaded on that page before evaluating @scripts. In addition, it will ensure the provided @assets are only loaded once per page no matter how many instances of this component there are, unlike @script, which will evaluate for every component instance on the page.",

You can learn more about these objects in the $wire documentation.\nIn addition to dispatching and listening for events from individual components in PHP, the global Livewire object allows you to interact with Livewire's event system from anywhere in your application:\nIn certain scenarios, you might need to unregister global Livewire events. For instance, when working with Alpine components and wire:navigate, multiple listeners may be registered as init is called when navigating between pages. To address this, utilize the destroy function, automatically invoked by Alpine. Loop through all your listeners within this function to unregister them and prevent any unwanted accumulation.\nLivewire allows you to hook into various parts of its global lifecycle using Livewire.hook():\nMore information about Livewire's JavaScript hooks can be found below.\nLivewire allows you to register custom directives using Livewire.directive().\nBelow is an example of a custom wire:confirm directive that uses JavaScript's confirm() dialog to confirm or cancel an action before it is sent to the server:\nHere is the implementation of wire:confirm using Livewire.directive():",

Most of these objects are available for Livewire's internal system or advanced users.\nGiven the following generic Counter component:\nLivewire exposes a JavaScript representation of the server-side component in the form of an object that is commonly referred to as $wire:\nYou can learn more about $wire in Livewire's documentation on accessing properties in JavaScript.\nBetween each network request, Livewire serializes the PHP component into an object that can be consumed in JavaScript. This snapshot is used to unserialize the component back into a PHP object and therefore has mechanisms built in to prevent tampering:\nEvery component on a page has a corresponding component object behind the scenes keeping track of its state and exposing its underlying functionality. This is one layer deeper than $wire. It is only meant for advanced usage.\nHere's an actual component object for the above Counter component with descriptions of relevant properties in JS comments:\nWhen an action is performed on a Livewire component in the browser, a network request is triggered. That network request contains one or many components and various instructions for the server. Internally, these component network payloads are called \"commits\".\nThe term \"commit\" was chosen as a helpful way to think about Livewire's relationship between frontend and backend. A component is rendered and manipulated on the frontend until an action is performed that requires it to \"commit\" its state and updates to the backend.\nYou will recognize this schema from the payload in the network tab of your browser's DevTools, or Livewire's JavaScript hooks:",

You can hook into component.init to intercept or initialize anything related to the new component:\nFor more information, please consult the documentation on the component object.\nIn addition to triggering an event when new components are initialized, Livewire triggers an event for each DOM element within a given Livewire component.\nThis can be used to provide custom Livewire HTML attributes within your application:\nDuring the DOM morphing phase—which occurs after Livewire completes a network roundtrip—Livewire triggers a series of events for every element that is mutated.\nIn addition to the events fired per element, a morph and morphed event is fired for each Livewire component:\nBecause Livewire requests contain multiple components, request is too broad of a term to refer to an individual component's request and response payload. Instead, internally, Livewire refers to component updates as commits — in reference to committing component state to the server.\nThese hooks expose commit objects. You can learn more about their schema by reading the commit object documentation.\nThe commit.prepare hook will be triggered immediately before a request is sent to the server. This gives you a chance to add any last minute updates or actions to the outgoing request:\nEvery time a Livewire component is sent to the server, a commit is made.
