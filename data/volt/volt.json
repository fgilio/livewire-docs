Volt then transforms and compiles the functional code into a conventional Livewire class, enabling us to leverage the extensive capabilities of Livewire with reduced boilerplate.\nVolt's API automatically binds any closure it uses to the underlying component. So, at any time, actions, computed properties, or listeners can refer to the component using the $this variable:\nIf you would like to enjoy the single-file component capabilities of Volt while still writing class-based components, we've got you covered. To get started, define an anonymous class that extends Livewire\\Volt\\Component. Within the class, you may utilize all of the features of Livewire using traditional Livewire syntax:\nJust like typical Livewire components, Volt components support class attributes. When utilizing anonymous PHP classes, class attributes should be defined after the new keyword:\nWhen using class-based Volt components, the rendered view is the template present in the same file. If you need to pass additional data to the view each time it is rendered, you may use the with method. This data will be passed to the view in addition to the component's public properties:\nSometimes, you may wish to interact with the view instance directly, for example, to set the view's title using a translated string. To achieve this, you may define a rendering method on your component:",

You can define a property using the state function:\nIf the initial value of a state property relies on outside dependencies, such as database queries, models, or container services, its resolution should be encapsulated within a closure. This prevents the value from being resolved until it is absolutely necessary:\nIf the initial value of a state property is being injected via Laravel Folio's route model binding, it should also be encapsulated within a closure:\nOf course, properties may also be declared without explicitly specifying their initial value. In such cases, their initial value will be null or will be set based on the properties passed into the component when it is rendered:\nLivewire offers the ability to safeguard properties by enabling you to \"lock\" them, thereby preventing any modifications from occurring on the client-side. To achieve this using Volt, simply chain the locked method on the state you wish to protect:\nWhen working with nested components, you may find yourself in a situation where you need to pass a property from a parent component to a child component, and have the child component automatically update when the parent component updates the property.\nTo achieve this using Volt, you may chain the reactive method on the state you wish to be reactive:\nIn cases where you don't want to make use of reactive properties, Livewire provides a modelable feature where you may share state between parent component and child component using wire:model directly on a child component.\nTo achieve this using Volt, simply chain the modelable method on the state you wish to be modelable:\nLivewire also allows you to define computed properties, which can be useful for lazily fetching information needed by your component. Computed property results are \"memoized\", or cached in memory, for an individual Livewire request lifecycle.\nTo define a computed property, you may use the computed function. The name of the variable will determine the name of the computed property:\nYou may persist the computed property's value in your application's cache by chaining the persist method onto the computed property definition:\nBy default, Livewire caches the computed property's value for 3600 seconds. You may customize this value by providing the desired number of seconds to the persist method:",
