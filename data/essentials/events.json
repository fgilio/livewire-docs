            "content": "To listen for an event in a Livewire component, add the #[On] attribute above the method you want to be called when a given event is dispatched:\nMake sure you import any attribute classes. For example, the below #[On()] attributes requires the following import use Livewire\\Attributes\\On;.\nNow, when the post-created event is dispatched from CreatePost, a network request will be triggered and the updatePostList() action will be invoked.\nAs you can see, additional data sent with the event will be provided to the action as its first argument.\nOccasionally, you may want to dynamically generate event listener names at run-time using data from your component.\nFor example, if you wanted to scope an event listener to a specific Eloquent model, you could append the model's ID to the event name when dispatching like so:\nAnd then listen for that specific model:\nIf the above $post model had an ID of 3, the refreshPost() method would only be triggered by an event named: post-updated.3.\nLivewire allows you to listen for events directly on individual child components in your Blade template like so:\nIn the above scenario, if the edit-post child component dispatches a saved event, the parent's $refresh will be called and the parent will be refreshed.\nInstead of passing $refresh, you can pass any method you normally would to something like wire:click. Here's an example of calling a close() method that might do something like close a modal dialog:\nIf the child dispatched parameters along with the request, for example $this->dispatch('saved', postId: 1), you can forward those values to the parent method using the following syntax:",
