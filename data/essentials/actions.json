For example, if you have a component checking the status of something in the database, you may want to show a button to your users allowing them to refresh the displayed results.\nYou can do this using Livewire's simple $refresh action anywhere you would normally reference your own component method:\nWhen the $refresh action is triggered, Livewire will make a server-roundtrip and re-render your component without calling any methods.\nIt's important to note that any pending data updates in your component (for example wire:model bindings) will be applied on the server when the component is refreshed.\nInternally, Livewire uses the name \"commit\" to refer to any time a Livewire component is updated on the server. If you prefer this terminology, you can use the $commit helper instead of $refresh. The two are identical.\nYou can also trigger a component refresh using AlpineJS in your Livewire component:\nLearn more by reading the documentation for using Alpine inside Livewire.",

            "content": "Livewire supports a variety of event listeners, allowing you to respond to various types of user interactions:\nBecause the event name after wire: can be anything, Livewire supports any browser event you might need to listen for. For example, to listen for transitionend, you can use wire:transitionend.\nYou can use one of Livewire's convenient aliases to narrow down key press event listeners to a specific key or combination of keys.\nFor example, to perform a search when a user hits Enter after typing into a search box, you can use wire:keydown.enter:\nYou can chain more key aliases after the first to listen for combinations of keys. For example, if you would like to listen for the Enter key only while the Shift key is pressed, you may write the following:\nBelow is a list of all the available key modifiers:\nLivewire also includes helpful modifiers to make common event-handling tasks trivial.\nFor example, if you need to call event.preventDefault() from inside an event listener, you can suffix the event name with .prevent:\nHere is a full list of all the available event listener modifiers and their functions:\nBecause wire: uses Alpine's x-on directive under the hood, these modifiers are made available to you by Alpine. For more context on when you should use these modifiers, consult the Alpine Events documentation.\nLivewire also supports listening for custom events fired by third-party libraries.\nFor example, let's imagine you're using the Trix rich text editor in your project and you want to listen for the trix-change event to capture the editor's content. You can accomplish this using the wire:trix-change directive:\nIn this example, the setPostContent action is called whenever the trix-change event is triggered, updating the content property in the Livewire component with the current value of the Trix editor.\nWithin Livewire event handlers, you can access the event object via $event. This is useful for referencing information on the event. For example, you can access the element that triggered the event via $event.target.\nThe Trix demo code above is incomplete and only useful as a demonstration of event listeners. If used verbatim, a network request would be fired on every single keystroke. A more performant implementation would be:\nIf your application dispatches custom events from Alpine, you can also listen for those using Livewire:\nWhen the button is clicked in the above example, the custom-event event is dispatched and bubbles up to the root of the Livewire component where wire:custom-event catches it and invokes a given action.\nIf you want to listen for an event dispatched somewhere else in your application, you will need to wait instead for the event to bubble up to the window object and listen for it there. Fortunately, Livewire makes this easy by allowing you to add a simple .window modifier to any event listener:\nConsider the CreatePost example we previously discussed:\nWhen a user clicks \"Save\", a network request is sent to the server to call the save() action on the Livewire component.\nBut, let's imagine that a user is filling out this form on a slow internet connection. The user clicks \"Save\" and nothing happens initially because the network request takes longer than usual. They might wonder if the submission failed and attempt to click the \"Save\" button again while the first request is still being handled.\nIn this case, there would be two requests for the same action being processed at the same time.\nTo prevent this scenario, Livewire automatically disables the submit button and all form inputs inside the <form> element while a wire:submit action is being processed. This ensures that a form isn't accidentally submitted twice.\nTo further lessen the confusion for users on slower connections, it is often helpful to show some loading indicator such as a subtle background color change or SVG animation.\nLivewire provides a wire:loading directive that makes it trivial to show and hide loading indicators anywhere on a page. Here's a short example of using wire:loading to show a loading message below the \"Save\" button:\nwire:loading is a powerful feature with a variety of more powerful features. Check out the full loading documentation for more information.",

You can pass the post's ID as a parameter to the delete() action in your Livewire component. Then, the action can fetch the relevant post and delete it from the database:\nFor a post with an ID of 2, the \"Delete\" button in the Blade template above will render in the browser as:\nWhen this button is clicked, the delete() method will be called and $id will be passed in with a value of \"2\".\nAction parameters should be treated just like HTTP request input, meaning action parameter values should not be trusted. You should always authorize ownership of an entity before updating it in the database.\nFor more information, consult our documentation regarding security concerns and best practices.\nAs an added convenience, you may automatically resolve Eloquent models by a corresponding model ID that is provided to an action as a parameter. This is very similar to route model binding. To get started, type-hint an action parameter with a model class and the appropriate model will automatically be retrieved from the database and passed to the action instead of the ID:",

This means you can take full advantage of Alpine within your components to add JavaScript powered client-side interactivity.\nTo make this pairing even more powerful, Livewire exposes a magic $wire object to Alpine that can be treated as a JavaScript representation of your PHP component. In addition to accessing and mutating public properties via $wire, you can call actions. When an action is invoked on the $wire object, the corresponding PHP method will be invoked on your backend Livewire component:\nOr, to illustrate a more complex example, you might use Alpine's x-intersect utility to trigger a incrementViewCount() Livewire action when a given element is visible on the page:\nAny parameters you pass to the $wire method will also be passed to the PHP class method. For example, consider the following Livewire action:\nWithin your component's Blade template, you can invoke this action via Alpine, providing the parameter that should be given to the action:\nIf a user had typed in \"Take out the trash\" into the text input and the pressed the \"Add Todo\" button, the addTodo() method will be triggered with the $todo parameter value being \"Take out the trash\".\nFor even more power, invoked $wire actions return a promise while the network request is processing. When the server response is received, the promise resolves with the value returned by the backend action.\nFor example, consider a Livewire component that has the following action:\nUsing $wire, the action may be invoked and its returned value resolved:\nIn this example, if the getPostCount() method returns \"10\", the <span> tag will also contain \"10\".\nAlpine knowledge is not required when using Livewire; however, it's an extremely powerful tool and knowing Alpine will augment your Livewire experience and productivity.",

To use $set, provide the property you want to update and the new value as arguments:\nIn this example, when the button is clicked, a network request is dispatched that sets the $query property in the component to ''.\nThe $refresh action triggers a re-render of your Livewire component. This can be useful when updating the component's view without changing any property values:\nWhen the button is clicked, the component will re-render, allowing you to see the latest changes in the view.\nThe $toggle action is used to toggle the value of a boolean property in your Livewire component:\nIn this example, when the button is clicked, the $sortAsc property in the component will toggle between true and false.\nThe $dispatch action allows you to dispatch a Livewire event directly in the browser. Below is an example of a button that, when clicked, will dispatch the post-deleted event:\nThe $event action may be used within event listeners like wire:click.

If so, you can skip the render portion of Livewire's lifecycle by adding the #[Renderless] attribute above the action method.\nTo demonstrate, in the ShowPost component below, the \"view count\" is logged when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the post:\nThe example above uses x-intersect, an Alpine utility that calls the expression when the element enters the viewport (typically used to detect when a user scrolls to an element further down the page).\nAs you can see, when a user scrolls to the bottom of the post, incrementViewCount() is invoked. Since #[Renderless] was added to the action, the view is logged, but the template doesn't re-render and no part of the page is affected.\nIf you prefer to not utilize method attributes or need to conditionally skip rendering, you may invoke the skipRender() method in your component action:",

            "content": "Remember that any public method in your Livewire component can be called from the client-side, even without an associated wire:click handler that invokes it. In these scenarios, users can still trigger the action from the browser's DevTools.\nBelow are three examples of easy-to-miss vulnerabilities in Livewire components. Each will show the vulnerable component first and the secure component after. As an exercise, try spotting the vulnerabilities in the first example before viewing the solution.\nIf you are having difficulty spotting the vulnerabilities and that makes you concerned about your ability to keep your own applications secure, remember all these vulnerabilities apply to standard web applications that use requests and controllers. If you use a component method as a proxy for a controller method, and its parameters as a proxy for request input, you should be able to apply your existing application security knowledge to your Livewire code.\nJust like controller request input, it's imperative to authorize action parameters since they are arbitrary user input.\nBelow is a ShowPosts component where users can view all their posts on one page. They can delete any post they like using one of the post's \"Delete\" buttons.\nHere is a vulnerable version of the component:\nRemember that a malicious user can call delete() directly from a JavaScript console, passing any parameters they would like to the action. This means that a user viewing one of their posts can delete another user's post by passing the un-owned post ID to delete().\nTo protect against this, we need to authorize that the user owns the post about to be deleted:\nLike standard Laravel controllers, Livewire actions can be called by any user, even if there isn't an affordance for invoking the action in the UI.\nConsider the following BrowsePosts component where any user can view all the posts in the application, but only administrators can delete a post:\nAs you can see, only administrators can see the \"Delete\" button; however, any user can call deletePost() on the component from the browser's DevTools.\nTo patch this vulnerability, we need to authorize the action on the server like so:\nWith this change, only administrators can delete a post from this component.\nEvery public method inside your Livewire component is callable from the client. Even methods you haven't referenced inside a wire:click handler. To prevent a user from calling a method that isn't intended to be callable client-side, you should mark them as protected or private. By doing so, you restrict the visibility of that sensitive method to the component's class and its subclasses, ensuring they cannot be called from the client-side.\nConsider the BrowsePosts example that we previously discussed, where users can view all posts in your application, but only administrators can delete posts. In the Always authorize server-side section, we made the action secure by adding server-side authorization. Now imagine we refactor the actual deletion of the post into a dedicated method like you might do in order to simplify your code:\nAs you can see, we refactored the post deletion logic into a dedicated method named delete(). Even though this method isn't referenced anywhere in our template, if a user gained knowledge of its existence, they would be able to call it from the browser's DevTools because it is public.\nTo remedy this, we can mark the method as protected or private. Once the method is marked as protected or private, an error will be thrown if a user tries to invoke it:",
