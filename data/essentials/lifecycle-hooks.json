These hooks enable you to perform actions before or after particular events, such as initializing the component, updating properties, or rendering the template.",

            "content": "In a standard PHP class, a constructor (__construct()) takes in outside parameters and initializes the object's state. However, in Livewire, you use the mount() method for accepting parameters and initializing the state of your component.\nLivewire components don't use __construct() because Livewire components are re-constructed on subsequent network requests, and we only want to initialize the component once when it is first created.\nHere's an example of using the mount() method to initialize the name and email properties of an UpdateProfile component:\nAs mentioned earlier, the mount() method receives data passed into the component as method parameters:\nLivewire allows you to resolve dependencies out of Laravel's service container by type-hinting method parameters on lifecycle hooks.\nThe mount() method is a crucial part of using Livewire. The following documentation provides further examples of using the mount() method to accomplish common tasks:",

            "content": "As helpful as mount() is, it only runs once per component lifecycle, and you may want to run logic at the beginning of every single request to the server for a given component.\nFor these cases, Livewire provides a boot() method where you can write component setup code that you intend to run every single time the component class is booted: both on initialization and on subsequent requests.\nThe boot() method can be useful for things like initializing protected properties, which are not persisted between requests. Below is an example of initializing a protected property as an Eloquent model:\nYou can use this technique to have complete control over initializing a component property in your Livewire component.\nThe technique used above is powerful; however, it's often better to use Livewire's computed properties to solve this use case.\nAs you can see above, we are using the #[Locked] attribute on the $postId property. In a scenario like the above, where you want to ensure the $postId property isn't tampered with by users on the client-side, it's important to authorize the property's value before using it or add #[Locked] to the property ensure it is never changed.\nFor more information, check out the documentation on Locked properties.",

            "title": "#Update",
            "content": "Client-side users can update public properties in many different ways, most commonly by modifying an input with wire:model on it.\nLivewire provides convenient hooks to intercept the updating of a public property so that you can validate or authorize a value before it's set, or ensure a property is set in a given format.\nBelow is an example of using updating to prevent the modification of the $postId property.\nIt's worth noting that for this particular example, in an actual application, you should use the #[Locked] attribute instead, like in the above example.\nThe above updating() method runs before the property is updated, allowing you to catch invalid input and prevent the property from updating. Below is an example of using updated() to ensure a property's value stays consistent:\nNow, anytime the $username property is updated client-side, we will ensure that the value will always be lowercase.\nBecause you are often targeting a specific property when using update hooks, Livewire allows you to specify the property name directly as part of the method name. Here's the same example from above but rewritten utilizing this technique:\nOf course, you can also apply this technique to the updating hook.\nArray properties have an additional $key argument passed to these functions to specify the changing element.\nNote that when the array itself is updated instead of a specific key, the $key argument is null.",

However, there are specific scenarios where they can be powerful.\nThe terms \"dehydrate\" and \"hydrate\" refer to a Livewire component being serialized to JSON for the client-side and then unserialized back into a PHP object on the subsequent request.\nWe often use the terms \"hydrate\" and \"dehydrate\" to refer to this process throughout Livewire's codebase and the documentation. If you'd like more clarity on these terms, you can learn more by consulting our hydration documentation.\nLet's look at an example that uses both mount() , hydrate(), and dehydrate() all together to support using a custom data transfer object (DTO) instead of an Eloquent model to store the post data in the component:\nNow, from actions and other places inside your component, you can access the PostDto object instead of the primitive data.\nThe above example mainly demonstrates the abilities and nature of the hydrate() and dehydrate() hooks. However, it is recommended that you use Wireables or Synthesizers to accomplish this instead.",
