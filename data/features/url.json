For example, you may want a $search property in your component to be included in the URL: https://example.com/users?search=bob. This is particularly useful for things like filtering, sorting, and pagination, as it allows users to share and bookmark specific states of a page.",

            "content": "Below is a ShowUsers component that allows you to search users by their name via a simple text input:\nAs you can see, because the text input uses wire:model.live=\"search\", as a user types into the field, network requests will be sent to update the $search property and show a filtered set of users on the page.\nHowever, if the visitor refreshes the page, the search value and results will be lost.\nTo preserve the search value across page loads so that a visitor can refresh the page or share the URL, we can store the search value in the URL's query string by adding the #[Url] attribute above the $search property like so:\nNow, if a user types \"bob\" into the search field, the URL bar in the browser will show:\nIf they now load this URL from a new browser window, \"bob\" will be filled in the search field, and the user results will be filtered accordingly.",

In many cases, this is expected, however there are times when you want ?search= to be treated as null.\nIn these cases, you can use a nullable typehint like so:\nBecause ? is present in the above typehint, Livewire will see ?search= and set $search to null instead of an empty string.\nThis works the other way around as well, if you set $this->search = null in your application, it will be represented in the query string as ?search=.",

Most of the time, this is the desired behavior, however, there are certain scenarios where you may want more control over which value Livewire excludes from the query string. In these cases you can use the except parameter.\nFor example, in the component below, the initial value of $search is modified in mount(). To ensure the browser will only ever exclude search from the query string if the search value is an empty string, the except parameter has been added to #[Url]:\nWithout except in the above example, Livewire would remove the search entry from the query string any time the value of search is equal to the initial value of auth()->user()->username.
