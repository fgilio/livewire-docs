            "content": "By default, Livewire will insert an empty <div></div> for your component before it is fully loaded. As the component will initially be invisible to users, it can be jarring when the component suddenly appears on the page.\nTo signal to your users that the component is being loaded, you can define a placeholder() method to render any kind of placeholder HTML you like, including loading spinners and skeleton placeholders:\nBecause the above component specifies a \"placeholder\" by returning HTML from a placeholder() method, the user will see an SVG loading spinner on the page until the component is fully loaded.\nFor instance, if your placeholder's root element type is a 'div,' your component must also use a 'div' element.\nFor more complex loaders (such as skeletons) you can return a view from the placeholder() similar to render().\nAny parameters from the component being lazy loaded will be available as an $params argument passed to the placeholder() method.",

However, because we won't run mount() until the next network request, Livewire will internally serialize $user to JSON and then re-query it from the database before the next request is handled.\nTypically, this serialization should not cause any behavioral differences in your application.",
