For example, when streaming a response from a chatbot, typically appending is desired (and is therefore the default). However, when showing something like a count-down, replacing is more fitting.\nYou can configure either by passing the replace: parameter to $this->stream with a boolean value:\nAppend/replace can also be specified at the target element level by appending or removing the .replace modifier:",
